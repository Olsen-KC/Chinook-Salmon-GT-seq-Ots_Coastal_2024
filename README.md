# Ots_Coastal_2024
## Objective is to consolidate datasets from four different genotyping efforts in order to evaluate the genetic diversity and connectivity of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Northern California and Oregon. Genotyping efforts 1 & 2 were conducted and quality filtered by David I Dayan (DID), efforts 3 & 4 were conducted and quality filtered by Kevin C Olsen (KCO). 

## 1. 2020/2021 - Coastal Chinook includes North & South Umpqua and Oregon Coast (OC). Link [here](https://github.com/david-dayan/Umpqua_Ots_OC_or_SONCC/tree/main/genotype_data/OC_Umpqua)

## 2. 2020 - Rogue. Link [here](https://github.com/david-dayan/Umpqua_Ots_OC_or_SONCC/tree/main/genotype_data/Rogue)

## 3. 2023 - Fall Chinook. Link [here](https://github.com/Olsen-KC/Ots_Coastal_2024/tree/main/2023_Fall_Coastal_Chinook)

## 4. 2023 - Coquille. Link [here](https://github.com/Olsen-KC/Ots_COQR_2023/tree/main/filtering_record_filtered_genotypes) 

## 2020_2021_Umpqua_OC: R object of filtered genotypes and metadata from #1 
## 2020_Rogue: R object of filtered genotypes and metadata from #2 
## 2023_Fall_Coastal_Chinook: Initial output from GT-seq genotyping, quality filtering record, and R object of filtered genotypes from #3. 
## Consolidation: R markdown html script detailing the joining of genotype files. Combined genotype/metadata files with those markers present across genotyping efforts (Ots_coastal_2024_298_markers.R) and all markers that passed quality filtering in each genotyping effort (Ots_coastal_2024_339_markers.R).
